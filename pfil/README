Installation.
-------------

1. Build package
----------------
At a shell prompt, do:

make package

This will compile and create pfil.pkg.  Copy this to the destination
machine, where you will install the package.

To build with gcc:
make -f Makefile.gcc package

2. Install package
------------------
Run the following command from a shell prompt:

pkgadd -d /tmp/pfil.pkg

Check the file /etc/opt/pfil/iu.ap.  It should contain one line for
each network interface type, excluding the loopback (lo).  You must now
reboot the system.

3. Check configuration
----------------------

As root, run this command:

strconf < /dev/hme

(assuming there is a hme network interface configured).  This should
produce two lines of output, one with 'pfil' (1st) and one with 'hme'
(2nd).


4. Use on Solaris8 and later with ifconfig.
-------------------------------------------
If you do "ifconfig <if> modlist", you will see a list of STREAMS modules
pushed onto the interface like this (for hme0):
0 arp
1 ip
2 hme
You need to insert pfil between ip and hme.  To do this, you do the
following:
ifconfig hme0 modinsert pfil@2
checking the list, you should see:
0 arp
1 ip
2 pfil
3 hme

5. Confirming Interfaces Attached.
----------------------------------
pfil supports the ndd interface and the list of active interfaces can be
queried as follows:

# ndd /dev/pfil qif_status
ifname ill q OTHERQ num sap hl len nr nw bad copy drop notip nodata notdata
hme0     f665d174 f6424df0 f6424e6c 0 800 14 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 2

The list of commands pfil supports via ndd is determined with:
# ndd /dev/pfil \?
