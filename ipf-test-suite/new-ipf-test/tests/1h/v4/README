The majority of the data files used here relate directly to the test files
used in the IPFilter test suite that is contained within IPFilter.

For example, the data held in 1h_ipf_parse_001_v4.data is the same as that
found in ipfilter/test/regress/i1.

As this test suite is provided independant of the core IPFilter package,
the test data is replicated here.
